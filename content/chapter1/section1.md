:::{prf:theorem} Orthogonal-Projection-Theorem
:label: my-theorem

Given $y \in \mathbb R^n$ and linear subspace $S \subset \mathbb R^n$,
there exists a unique solution to the minimization problem

```{math}
\hat y := \argmin_{z \in S} \|y - z\|
```

The minimizer $\hat y$ is the unique vector in $\mathbb R^n$ that satisfies

* $\hat y \in S$

* $y - \hat y \perp S$


The vector $\hat y$ is called the **orthogonal projection** of $y$ onto $S$.
